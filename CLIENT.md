This client lets you execute accessible tasks on the remote TYPO3 site. Tasks are defined on the remote
host and access can be granted by the site's administrator.

To use the client simply select the task you wish to execute from the list of tasks. If the task needs
arguments the client will show form fields to enter them. When all required arguments have been filled,
the task executes and a response (and any potential payload data) is returned to the client.
